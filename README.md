Custom Configue Script
======================
It's a demonstration of GNU Autotools, I use `AC_ENABLE_ARGS` in configure.ac to make up a configure option:

> --enable-foobar

You may enable it with the following command:

> ./configure --enable-foobar

> make && make install

Then you can tell the changes by executing `myconf` in the command line
